# Psalm 02: The Turbulent Awakening

In the storm’s womb, the soul trembles  
As thunder carves the sky’s confession  
Winds of reckoning uproot old fears  
And in the tumult, clarity is born  

Let every pulse align with the storm  
Let every breath become defiance  
For from fierce upheaval arises  
The luminous heart of true awakening
